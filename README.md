Mission: Learn a little git & Ansible

Ansible playbooks are copied from https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples 

These playbooks are tuned to work under Fedora Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

I have created a howto for creating a lab setup in VirtualBox under https://github.com/oivinde/tinkering/tree/master/lab_setup_virtualbox
